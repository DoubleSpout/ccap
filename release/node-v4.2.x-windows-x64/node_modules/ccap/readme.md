You can generate captcha without install any other libraries or software, only do npm install ccap, that's all.

**support node 0.12.x and 4.x.x**

node-ccap support linux, windows and mac.

compile maybe cost you 1 minute,simply wait;

linux support jpeg,windows and mac only support bmp!

*Please never using ccap in production on windows and mac, only with linux.*

## performance

  generate captcha picture 1204/sec;//BMP unzip

## Install

   npm install ccap 	  (new version, need node 0.12.x and 4.x.x, on linux need gcc v4.8+)

   npm install ccap@0.5.3 (stop update, need node 0.8.x - 0.10.x)

   var ccap = require('ccap')

   if you don't want to update gcc version, ccap package Compiled file is in folder `release`, just download it and copy it to your `node_modules`. 

## Instantiated

   these three ways all will be ok:

	var captcha = ccap();
	
	var captcha = ccap(width, height, offset);

	var captcha = ccap({
		
		width:256,//set width,default is 256

		height:60,//set height,default is 60

		offset:40,//set text spacing,default is 40

		quality:100,//set pic quality,default is 50

		fontsize:57,//set font size,default is 57

		generate:function(){//Custom the function to generate captcha text
		
		     //generate captcha text here

		     return text;//return the captcha text

		}
	
	});
	   

## API
   
	var captcha = ccap();

	var ary = captcha.get();//ary[0] is captcha's text,ary[1] is captcha picture buffer.

	var text = ary[0];

	var buffer = ary[1];


## Simple Example
	
	var http = require('http');
	
	var ccap = require('ccap')();//Instantiated ccap class 

	http.createServer(function (request, response) {

		if(request.url == '/favicon.ico')return response.end('');//Intercept request favicon.ico

		var ary = ccap.get();

		var txt = ary[0];

		var buf = ary[1];

		response.end(buf);

		console.log(txt);

	}).listen(8124);

	console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8124/');

# Stop and start timer cache

	var ccap = require('ccap')();

	ccap.timerIsRunning(); //now timer is running, return 1

	ccap.clearTimeout(); //stop all create capature image, so will use the same the 20(default is 20) capature images

	ccap.timerIsRunning();//now timer is stoped, return 0

	captcha8.setTimeout();//now timer is start again

	ccap.timerIsRunning();//now timer is stoped, return 1
